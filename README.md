# Project-4--Taxonomic-Class

Task 1--Preprocessing:
In a first step, you must split and clean the data and remove outliers. You have to split the data into three different sets based on the taxon classes ‘Mammalia’, ‘Aves’ and ‘Reptilia’ and remove all entries that have either deficient male or female data or both.

Task 2--Visualization:
We want to plot a vertical bar chart of the animals with the highest median life expectancy for each taxon class.
Which taxon class is displayed can be chosen by the user with a select widget to the right of the plot.
The limits of the horizontal bars are determined by ‘Overall ci – lower’ and ‘ Overall ci – upper’. Additionally,
there is a hover tool showing the limits of the bars.

Task 3--Running the file:
To run the python file install python 3.9 or later and install necessary packeges mentioin file.
Then run the following command in the folder where file is : python -m bokeh serve --show filename.py
